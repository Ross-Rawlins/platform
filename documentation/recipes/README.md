# ðŸ“œ Recipes

OpenHIM platform comes bundled with a set of generic packages that can be deployed and configured to support a number of different use cases. To help users of OpenHIM Platform get started with something they can make use of immediately, a number of default OpenHIM Platform recipes are provided. These help you get started with everything you need setup and configured for a particular use case.

These recipes combine and configure multiple packages together so that a functional HIE is stood up that is pre-configured to support a particular use case.

We currently support the following default recipes:
