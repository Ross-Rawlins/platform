# Introduction

## The Problem

- Rebuilding fresh solutions for every implementation that required a HIE (Health Informationm Exchange)
- Complexity with operating HIE systems with regards to 
    - scalability 
    - security 
    - deployment challenges 
    - high availability/fault tolerance 
    - monitoring
- Domain specific knowledge is required for most HIE services

## The Vision

Provide a **health information exchange solution** that has the following **features**:

- Centralises data from a variety of source systems
- Provides an analytics and reporting solution that is self service and low-code
- Provides a robust and highly scalable patient linking solution that makes the analytics more accurate and allows source system to make use of existing patient records
- Stores patient data longitudinally and allows source systems to access patient previous clinical history
- Has reusable components that may work in multiple domains of health
- Provide artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) fundamentals for data analysis

While ensuring the solution is **sustainable** by:

- Providing scripts and tools to setup and configure the solution automatically
- Providing deployment documentation and guidance for a fault tolerant solution, both on-prem and in cloud
- Provide training courses/material on how to maintain the solution
- Provide monitoring tools and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to help maintain the system and recover from disasters using simple management interfaces
- Follows development best practices - tested, CI/CD, etc
- Only build what is necessary and improve incrementally - reuse as many appropriate technologies as possible
- Highly efficient on resources (power, internet, processing power, cost)
- Providing training on the entire platform to enable a broad community to implement the solution
- Providing a comprehensive support plan
- Standards-based to that it is easy to plug in other source systems (semantic and syntactic)

While **supporting country needs** by:

- Being able to scale to national level
- Being customizable when necessary
- Supporting low connectivity and inconsistent power
- Allowing incremental adoption
- Providing security by default
- Providing excellent user experiences with rapid prototyping and co-creation with users
- Keep in mind the full range of users - we need to be improving patient care and improve clinical experience rather than only funder needs
